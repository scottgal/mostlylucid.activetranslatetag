mostlylucid.llmtranslate 1.0.0

- Switched demo and configuration to support Ollama providers by default.
- Added `OllamaTranslationProvider` with simple prompt-based translate and safe fallbacks.
- Preserved EasyNMT and OpenAI provider support for back-compat, but preference is for Ollama via `Ai:OllamaProviders`.
- Added chunking decorator support configurable via `LlmTranslate:Ai:Chunking`.
- NuGet metadata now links to repository root README and reads these release notes via MSBuild `System.IO.File.ReadAllText`.
